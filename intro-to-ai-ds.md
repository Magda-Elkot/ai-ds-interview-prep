# Introduction to AI and Data Science

## 1. Data Mining
- A part of data science.  
- Used to find hidden or useful information from raw data.  
- Example: from supermarket sales data, discover that people who buy bread often also buy butter.  

---

## 2. Ant Colony Intelligence
- A nature-inspired technique.  
- Any problem that can be shown as a graph (nodes and paths) can be solved with this.  
- Ants find the shortest path by leaving pheromone trails.  
- In AI, this is used for **optimization** (finding the best/shortest solution).  

---

## 3. Science vs Technology in AI and DS
- **Science** → the theory and concepts (what AI is, machine learning, how things work).  
- **Technology** → the tools to apply the science (Python, TensorFlow, hardware).  
- To be good in AI/DS, you need both theory and practice.  

---

## 4. What is AI?
- Making machines or software act like the human brain.  
- AI is a program that can interact intelligently with people and its environment.  

---

## 5. Types of AI
1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)** → does only one task well (e.g., Alexa, spam filter).  
2. **General AI (Strong AI / AGI)** → has human-like abilities (not achieved yet).  
3. **Super AI (ASI)** → smarter than humans (still theoretical).  

---

## 6. Turing Test
- A test to check if a machine can “think.”  
- A person chats (text only) with both a machine and a human.  
- If the person cannot tell which is the machine → the machine passes.  

---

## 7. Big Data
- Big data means very large and complex data.  
- Defined by the **4 V’s**:  
  - **Volume** → huge amounts  
  - **Velocity** → fast speed of generation  
  - **Variety** → different sources (text, video, sensors, etc.)  
  - **Veracity** → quality and accuracy of data  

---

## 8. Data Types
- **Structured Data** → organized in tables, has schema (e.g., Excel, SQL).  
- **Unstructured Data** → no fixed format (e.g., text, images, videos).  
- **Semi-Structured Data** → some structure but not tabular (e.g., JSON, XML).  

---

## 9. What is Data Science?
- Process of extracting knowledge and insights from data (structured + unstructured).  
- Uses analytics and ML to make predictions.  

---

## 10. Data Science Life Cycle
- It is an **iterative process** (repeatable).  
- Steps: Collect → Clean → Analyze → Model → Interpret → Deploy → Improve.  

---

## 11. AI vs Data Science
- **AI** → focuses on automation and making machines smart (e.g., self-driving car).  
- **DS** → focuses on finding patterns in data and predicting trends.  
- **Relation** →  
  - Data Science uses AI techniques for predictions.  
  - AI uses Data Science to build better models.  

---

## 12. AI and Robotics
- Robotics is about building physical machines.  
- AI is about making systems intelligent.  
- They are separate, but sometimes combined (intelligent robots).  

---

## 13. Applications
- **AI Applications** → computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), robotics.  
- **DS Applications** → data mining, business intelligence (BI).  

---

## 14. Soft Computing
- Deals with complex, uncertain, or imprecise problems.  
- Unlike “hard computing” (which needs exact answers), soft computing works with approximate solutions.  
- Examples: fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms.  

---

## 15. Approximate Reasoning
- Used when exact solutions are impossible or too hard.  
- Example: instead of saying “height = 185.2 cm,” we say “the person is tall.”  

---

## 16. Swarm Intelligence
- Inspired by the behavior of groups (ants, bees, birds).  
- Each individual finds a local solution and shares it.  
- The group works together to find the best global solution.  

---

## 17. Machine Learning (ML)
- Study of systems that can learn and improve from experience.  
- ML does not need to be explicitly programmed for every task.  

### Types of ML
1. **Supervised Learning** → train with labeled data (input → correct output).  
2. **Unsupervised Learning** → no labels, find hidden patterns.  
3. **Reinforcement Learning** → agent learns by trial & error, with rewards/penalties.  

### Special Types
- **Semi-Supervised** → mix of labeled and unlabeled data.  
- **Semi-Reinforcement** → agent learns with partial feedback.  

---

## 18. Deep Learning (DL)
- A subset of ML.  
- Uses **artificial neural networks (ANNs)** with many layers.  
- Learns higher-level features step by step.  
- Example: in images → edges → shapes → objects → full recognition.  

---

## 19. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Inspired by the human brain.  
- Made of nodes (“neurons”) connected together.  
- Each neuron processes information and passes output to the next.  

---

## 20. Cloud Computing
- Providing computing services (servers, databases, networking, analytics, AI tools) over the internet.  
- Example: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure.  

---

## 21. AI Hardware
- Special chips for AI tasks.  
- **GPU** → most common, fast for parallel processing.  
- **FPGA** → reconfigurable hardware.  
- **ASIC** → custom-made for specific AI tasks.  

---

## 22. Quantum Computing
- A new type of computing using quantum mechanics.  
- Can solve complex problems much faster than normal computers.  
- Still in research and development, but very powerful in theory.
